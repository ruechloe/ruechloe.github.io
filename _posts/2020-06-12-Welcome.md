Hi, there. Thanks for stopping by. Welcome to my little corner on the wide web. I will be documenting my journey, and many others'. Sharing stories about what matters to me most, that is, society. I am a firm believer in "Ubuntu" - I am because we are.

 As I learn and grow, I plan to dedicate part of my time to helping others. By sharing these stories, I hope to bring awareness to some of the problems affecting our society, and how we can all come together and help those who are most vulnerable. 

 <em>"How do I help?" </em> Well, you can start anywhere within your community where you see there is someone in need of assistance, no matter how small. If you want to contribute to some of these on going projects, please, feel free to reach out by email or any of the social media handles on this site!
